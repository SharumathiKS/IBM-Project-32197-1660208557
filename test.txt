1.	What Is Machine Learning, and How Does It Relate to AI?
Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming explicitly.
2.	 What Are Neural Networks, and How Do They Relate to AI? 
neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
3.	 What Is Deep Learning, and How Does It Relate to AI?
Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. 
4.	 What Is a Bayesian Network, and How Does It Relate to AI?
Bayesian-Network in AI can be utilized for building models from data and specialists' ideas,
5.	 What Is Supervised Versus Unsupervised Learning?
The main difference between supervised vs unsupervised learning is the need for labelled training data
6.	 Where does Artificial Intelligence go from here?
There are four types of artificial intelligence: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.
7.	 How can artificial intelligence be used to identify fraud?
AI is a wide term that alludes to the utilisation of specific sorts of investigation to follow through with responsibilities from driving a vehicle to fraud detection.
8.	 What are some common misunderstandings about AI?
Machines learn by themselves. That's the impression you get
Machines are objective. Nothing could be further from the truth

9.	 What role does computer vision play in AI?
Computer vision is a field of AI that trains computers to capture and interpret information from image and video data. 

10.	 How does the Strong AI differ from the Weak AI?
Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, focuses on performing a specific task, such as answering questions based on user input or playing chess
